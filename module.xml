"And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him" (Bible, John 1:32).  The descending dove is a very common motif on grave memorials.

            <description>Dramatically different interpretation between Eastern and Western cultures. In the Orient, the dragon protects humans from evil spirits and represents joy, health and fertility. But in Western cultures, the dragon possesses the negative traits of the snake, destruction, danger, depravity, and loss of innocence.

Also, a dragon being defeated by St. George depicts triumph over sin.</description>

          <opt>Lamb
            <description>This is the most common animal symbol found on a child's grave. The lamb appears throughout the ages with great regularity in Christian art and because it is a symbol of Christ: "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!" (John 1:29).  The use of the lamb in religious art pre-dates Christianity and appears to have been used first by the Egyptians. It signifies purity and innocence.

          </opt>
          <opt>Hands, clasped
            <description>At first glance, these hands all seem to be in the same fashion but a number of interesting characteristics stand out.  First, most of the hands illustrate the right hand in a grasp with fingers overlapping the other hand, while the left hand is open. This could be the depiction of a man holding a woman's hand and indicate marriage or a close bond between individuals, unity and affection even after death.  Clasped hands are also symbolic of a farewell or last good-bye.  Look at the cuff to distinguish between a man's or woman's hand (women would have a frilly cuff).  The person who died first holds the other's hand, guiding the spouse to heaven.  Clasped hands could be joined by a ribbon.</description>

Three interconnected circles represent the Holy Trinity.</description>

Patrick made the mark of a Latin cross through the circle and blessed the stone making the first Celtic Cross.</description>

            <description>The triskele, or triple spiral, a symbol closely related to the triquetra, is a tripartite symbol composed of three interlocked spirals.  The spiral is an ancient Celtic symbol related to the sun, afterlife and reincarnation, often found on Neolithic "tombs", such as Newgrange, where it is supposed by some to be a symbol of pregnancy (the sun describes a spiral in its movements every three months; a triple spiral represents nine months), an idea reinforced by the womb like nature of the structure. The symbol also suggests reincarnation- it is drawn in one continuous line, suggesting a continuous movement of time.  Triskeles are one of the most common elements of Celtic art; they are found in a variety of styles in both ancient and modern Celtic art, especially in relation to depictions of the Mother Goddess. They also evoke the Celtic concept of the domains of material existence- earth, water, and sky, and their interrelations.</description>

This symbol is also known as the Monogram of Christ, Constantine's Cross, the Chrismon, the Christogram and the Chi- Rho. Since the Roman emperor Constantine I used this symbol on his shield, overcame his enemy in battle, and consequently converted to Christianity, the labarum has been a symbol of Christianity.  In pre- Christian Greece it signified a good omen . It also represented the Chaldean sky god. Today the letters may be reversed as PX to represent "pax" or "peace".</description>

          <description>Acronym with several meanings.  Maybe represented as a monogram (see picture to left), or as a sequence of letters, 1.  The "I" stands for Ihsus or Ihcuc, the name of Jesus in Greek, with the S and C being variant forms in the Greek alphabet.  When these are found on tombstones it stresses the identity of the individual with Jesus Christ.  Originally a Roman Catholic, particularly Jesuit, symbol.2.  The letters have also been interpreted (with conscious intention to enrich the meaning) as "Jesus Hominum Salvator", or"Jesus Saviour of Mankind", and "In Hac Salus", "In This (Cross) Salvation" (OED).3.  "In hoc signo".  On the eve of battle, Constantine, had a vision of a banner bearing the phrase, "In hoc signo vinces", meaning "In this sign you will conquer".  Constantine won the battle and converted to Christianity. As it is used on both Protestant and Catholic gravestones, this symbol illustrates the variant meanings that can be ascribed to the one motif depending on denomination.

        <opt>Chains
          <description>Medieval thinkers sometimes held that a golden chain bound the soul to the body.  Broken links on a headstone can mean the severance and subsequent release of the spirit from the body.  Chains are also the insignia of the International Order of Odd Fellows, so called because of their dedication to giving the poor decent burials.  This latter association can be clinched by the observation of the letters IOOF or FLT (Friendship, Love, Truth) either inside or near the chain.</description>

They allow the expression of mourning to linger long after the body has been taken out the front door and the accoutrements have been stowed for the next death in the family.  Curtains can also set the stage.  Parted, they reveal a telling excerpt. What is important in such displays is the main actor or central object of the stone.</description>

          <description>Freemasons combine religious and construction and architectural forms in their symbols.  Viewing God as the architect and builder of the universe, Freemasonry intends to build the temple of humanity through self-improvement with stone-masonry work.  The compass, used in geometric calculations, symbolizes creation and the spirit.  The set-square draws perfect right angles, so represents uprightness and lawfulness.  The compass and the square measure things, so they symbolize judgment. They also represent geometry, and the union of the sky (the compass's circle) and the earth (the square).  The letter "G" in this symbol represents God, geometry and geomancy. </description>

The number of steps brings the meaning of numbers into the interpretation as does the symbolism of any objects that surround or are a part of the steps.  In Romanesque art, steps represent the relationship between worlds.  In many religions steps, or a ladder, are seen as the path to god.  For alchemists of the Middle Ages, steps were associated with the transmutation process.</description>
