          <opt>Butterfly

          <opt>Dove
            <desc>An important symbolic animal in Christianity representing the Holy Spirit. The white dove is referred to in the story of baptism of Christ. "And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him" (Bible, John 1:32).  The descending dove is a very common motif on grave memorials.  Seven doves are representative of the seven spirits of God or the Holy Spirit in its sevenfold gifts of grace. Purity, devotion, Divine Spirit. People of the Jewish faith believe the dove to symbolize peace.</desc>
          </opt>
          <opt>Dove and Olive Branch
            <desc>Peace, hope or promise. This symbol stems from Judeo-Christian culture and the biblical story of Noah and the great flood.  When the dove returned to the ark with an olive branch from the Mount of Olives in its beak, it was a sign of God's forgiveness.  It is now a common secular symbol.</desc>
          </opt>
          <opt>Dragon
            <desc>Dramatically different interpretation between Eastern and Western cultures. In the Orient, the dragon protects humans from evil spirits and represents joy, health and fertility. But in Western cultures, the dragon possesses the negative traits of the snake, destruction, danger, depravity, and loss of innocence. In Jewish tradition, mythical danger, depravity, and loss of innocence. In Jewish tradition, mythical beasts like the dragon are messianic creatures. Also, a dragon being defeated by St. George depicts triumph over sin.</desc>

          <opt>Egg
            <desc>Regeneration. An "egg and dart" motif was a common design in classical architecture and used on the edges of tombstones or as a frieze, symbolising resurrection after death.  The egg symbolised life and birth while the dart (arrow) depicted death. </desc>

          </opt>
          <opt>Lamb
            <desc>This is the most common animal symbol found on a child's grave. The lamb appears throughout the ages with great regularity in Christian art and because it is a symbol of Christ: "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!" (John 1:29).  The use of the lamb in religious art pre-dates Christianity and appears to have been used first by the Egyptians. It signifies purity and innocence. Christ in his sacrificial role and personifies: innocence, meekness, gentleness and humility.</desc>

          <opt>Lion
            <desc>The power of God and guards the tomb against evil spirits. Like other guardians, the lion's watch is as eternal as the stone of which it is depicted. The lion also recalls the courage and determination of the souls which they guard; they manifest the spirit of the departed. Resurrection.</desc>

            <desc>The incorruptibility of flesh, a symbol of immortality (even St. Augustine believed the peacock's flesh to have "antiseptic qualities" and that it didn't corrupt), the peacock became a symbol of Christ and the Resurrection. Its image embellished everything from the Catacombs to everyday objects, like lamps, especially in early Romanesque and Byzantine churches. (The peacock, for obvious reasons, was also used as a symbol for pride, too).</desc>

          <opt>Eye of God
            <desc>The all-knowing and ever-present God. During the Renaissance period in Europe, it was common to illustrate the Eye of God surrounded by a triangle (the Holy Trinity). The eye within the triangle, surrounded by a circle and radiating rays of light is used to symbolize the holiness of the true God.</desc>

          <opt>Hands,General
            <desc>The use of hands in some form is very common on grave memorials. Symbol of leaving.</desc>
          </opt>
          <opt>Hands, clasped
            <desc>At first glance, these hands all seem to be in the same fashion but a number of interesting characteristics stand out.  First, most of the hands illustrate the right hand in a grasp with fingers overlapping the other hand, while the left hand is open. This could be the depiction of a man holding a woman's hand and indicate marriage or a close bond between individuals, unity and affection even after death.  Clasped hands are also symbolic of a farewell or last good-bye.  Look at the cuff to distinguish between a man's or woman's hand (women would have a frilly cuff).  The person who died first holds the other's hand, guiding the spouse to heaven.  Clasped hands could be joined by a ribbon.</desc>

            <desc>The triskele, or triple spiral, a symbol closely related to the triquetra, is a tripartite symbol composed of three interlocked spirals.  The spiral is an ancient Celtic symbol related to the sun, afterlife and reincarnation, often found on Neolithic "tombs", such as Newgrange, where it is supposed by some to be a symbol of pregnancy (the sun describes a spiral in its movements every three months; a triple spiral represents nine months), an idea reinforced by the womb like nature of the structure. The symbol also suggests reincarnation- it is drawn in one continuous line, suggesting a continuous movement of time.  Triskeles are one of the most common elements of Celtic art; they are found in a variety of styles in both ancient and modern Celtic art, especially in relation to depictions of the Mother Goddess. They also evoke the Celtic concept of the domains of material existence- earth, water, and sky, and their interrelations.</desc>

Since the Roman emperor Constantine I used this symbol on his shield, overcame his enemy in battle, and consequently converted to Christianity, the labarum has been a symbol of Christianity.  In pre- Christian Greece it signified a good omen . It also represented the Chaldean sky god. Today the letters may be reversed as PX to represent "pax" or "peace".</desc>

When these are found on tombstones it stresses the identity of the individual with Jesus Christ.  Originally a Roman Catholic, particularly Jesuit, symbol.2.  The letters have also been interpreted (with conscious intention to enrich the meaning) as "Jesus Hominum Salvator", or"Jesus Saviour of Mankind", and "In Hac Salus", "In This (Cross) Salvation" (OED).3.  "In hoc signo".  On the eve of battle, Constantine, had a vision of a banner bearing the phrase, "In hoc signo vinces", meaning "In this sign you will conquer".  Constantine won the battle and converted to Christianity. As it is used on both Protestant and Catholic gravestones, this symbol illustrates the variant meanings that can be ascribed to the one motif depending on denomination. (Mytum 2003, 140).</desc>
